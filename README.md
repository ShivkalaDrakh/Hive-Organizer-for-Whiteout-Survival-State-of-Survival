# Hive Organizer</center> 
### A tool for Whiteout Survival and State of Survival

The Hive Organizer is a tool for alliance leaders and co-leaders to optimize and organize the hive of the alliance.
Easy to build from scratch, load a predefined hive, edit your own, and allocate your alliance members!

Move members around by DnD there cities, enter terrain obstacles or move a whole bunch of buildings with one simple
action!
### Build your Hive
Add Cities, Flags, HQ, Trap and Obstacles (Rocks)

### Assign Member Positions
Just Click on the Member name and the city position (in Assign Mode)

The City is then assigned to the Member, the number on the City corresponding to the number in the Member List.
A Mouse-over over the City shows the name of the alliance member. Overwritting and re-positioning is just as easy.
(Video will be added)

### Re-build and modify
Whether you want to just move a few buildings around or a whole block of Cities and Flags, just right-click-drag 
an area and move the seleced buildings in one go.

### Isometric View
As the game has a 45Â° isometric view, it is not always easy to get the  game grid correctly alligned with the buildings.
Therefore, the Hive can be displayed in Ismetric View to have the same orientation as in the game!

## Just play with it
This is a very early version of the tool, so just try it out, and send me some feedback!
Whether it's a bug report, a feature you'd like to have added, general criticism or just a few nice words,
everything is appreciated!

Have Fun!

### Examples
An example Hive and example Member lists are in the "save" folder
